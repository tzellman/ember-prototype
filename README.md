# ember-prototype

An Ember addon that allows you to quickly bootup new projects or amend existing projects with 
pre-defined configurations, dependencies and files.

I found myself repeating the same steps after initializing a new Ember project. Typically, I have
a set of "favorite addons" that I use for a variety of project types. This addon was born out of the
necessity to automate some of this repetitive setup.

## Using in your projects

* `ember install ember-prototype`
* `ember g proto-tzellman-base`

Of course, you should apply the blueprint(s) that you want.

## Contributing

If you find this useful, you can either clone this repository, or open a PR that contains your
blueprints.

* `git clone git@github.com:tzellman/ember-prototype.git`

The general naming strategy is to prefix your blueprint name with `proto-`. It might be wise to
include your github name or some other unique identifier as well.

Also, if you have any ideas on how to make this better, please let me know!
